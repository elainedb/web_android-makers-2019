# Practical JFixture

Tests need data, let’s see how can we create them using  [JFixture](https://github.com/FlexTradeUKLtd/jfixture). In this article we’ll go through some practical usage patterns of JFixture, and compare those to some other alternatives.

**_Note_**_: this article was originally_ [_published here with richer formatting_](http://www.twisterrob.net/blog/2019/03/practical-jfixture.html)_._

### Introduction

> _JFixture is a Java library to assist in the writing of Unit Tests, particularly when following Test Driven Development. It generates types based on the concept of “constrained non-determinism”, which is an implementation of the_ [_Generated Value_](http://xunitpatterns.com/Generated%20Value.html) _xUnit test pattern. —_[_JFixture README.md_](https://github.com/FlexTradeUKLtd/jfixture)

In practice this means, is that JFixture can create any data object with very little developer effort, here’s an example:

```
private val fixture = JFixture()

@Test fun test() {
    val fixtJourney: Journey = fixture();
    val result = sut.process(fixtJourney);
    assertNotNull(result);
}
```

Compare this to the classic approach where we would need to create each object individually, filling in the properties with dummy values, and potentially creating constants for these values. No matter how deep or complicated it gets, JFixture usually finds a way to create an instance with all the data filled in.

```
val journey = Journey(
    "",
    listOf(
	    Leg(
		    Stop("", ""),
		    LocalDateTime.now(),
		    TransportMode.TRAIN,
		    Stop("", ""),
		    LocalDataTime.now()
		),
		Leg(
			Stop("", ""),
			LocalDateTime.now(),
			TransportMode.TRAIN,
			Stop("", ""),
			LocalDataTime.now()
		)
	)
)
```

> **Note**: In this article I use JUnit Jupiter and Mockito + Mockito Kotlin as the testing frameworks; and Kotlin as the language, because of its conciseness. While JFixture was written for the JVM with Java in mind it works for Kotlin too due to Kotlin’s awesome interoperability. Everything you see here applies to Java as well (unless it’s about using some Kotlin language feature).
