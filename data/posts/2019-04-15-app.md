It's split in 3 sections:

- The 2 days schedule
- Venue Informations
- About and list of our partners

#The schedule

All sessions of the Android Makers event will be held in the four rooms of the venue. From the application, you can know which sessions are next at a glance.

Within the app, you are also able to filter the session by their language and make you own schedule by selecting the sessions you are interested in. A notification will be sent when a selected session is about to start.

#Venue info

Access information to the venue are given, along the map of the venue, and information about the afterparty. 

For iOS or other OS users, we invite you to use our website directly :)

See you soon!
